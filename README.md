# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
V. Isualize has reached out to get an analysis of PyBer ride sharing data. With this data, they will be able to understand the ridership and fare metrics in the types of cites that their company operates in. When you are able to create visualizations of this data, PyBer is able to improve their access in underserved neighborhoods.

## Results
With the image below, you will be able to see a breakdown of the three types of areas, Rural, Suburband, and Urband, and the breakdown of each categorty.

- You can see that overall, Urban areas had the most total rides, with 1,625. That is 1,000 more rides than the Suburban areas, and 1,500 more rides than the Rural areas.
- In regard to total drivers, it does make sense that there would be more drives in the Urban areas, with 2,405, than the Rural and Suburban areas. There is more drivers in the Urban areas than Rural and Suburband combined. 
- Looking at the number of rides and the average fare per driver, it's interesting. While Urban drivers have a higher chance of getting more rides, there is a significatnly lower average fare. 

## Summary
After running and looking through the data, I would reccommend that Pyber increase the number of drivers in Rural and Suburband areas. There are significatnly higher drivers than rides in the Urban areas, which is leading to a lower average fare per driver. If some drivers started taking more rides in the other two areas, it would start to level all three areas. This would also provide more drivers for any needed rides in the Rural and Suburband areas.
